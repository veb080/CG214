        <p>About Butter:</p><p>Butter is a three-year-old male domestic shorthair cat. He is a king-sized tan and white kitty, weighing 18 pounds. He was adopted by Vanessa from the Humane Society of Wicomico County in January of 2017. </p> <p>Butter enjoys shoelaces, leather, chin scratches, and treats. His hobbies include eating, sleeping, and sitting on cardboard.</p><p>In September of 2017, Butter will be moving with Vanessa to Jacksonville, North Carolina. Butter is a talkative passanger and will no doubt keep the conversation lively during their six-hour car ride.</p><p>About the Humane Society:</p><p>The Humane Society of Wicomico County is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization.  As such, we are governed by a Board of Directors and Executive Director that sets policies and procedures that are carried out by the staff.  We are not a Wicomico County entity and do not fall under their supervision.  We currently have a contract with Wicomico County and Town of Delmar to provide animal control services.  A separate contract with Wicomico County and City of Salisbury to house and care for the stray animals that come from within Wicomico County and City of Salisbury Public and Animal Control..</p>

        <p>In order to operate as the Humane Society, we rely on the support of the public in the form of donations, bequests and fund raising events.  We receive no money from the Humane Society of the United States, the American Humane Association or any other national or regional Humane Society or  SPCA.</p>

        <p>As we offer animal control services, we are an open-admission shelter.  This means that any stray animal that comes from Wicomico County is not turned away.  Shelters that do not offer animal control services can refuse an animal they deem unadoptable or when they are full. To turn away animals is unfair to the animal and to the residents of their community by not offering any options. Sadly this means that sometimes the animals that come to us are not adoptable due to being medically untreatable, diseased, or aggressive.  Not all animals remain mentally stable or physically healthy due to the stresses of long-term kenneling.  When this is the case, these animals are humanely euthanized. Realizing that what you may be able to do for one single animal at home; we cannot do in a shelter environment as we have to keep in mind the health and safety of all our animals. Additionally, the financial impact if we spend thousands of dollars on a single animal, how does that affect our ability to help hundreds of more animals.</p>

        <p>Our goal is to adopt all of our adoptable animals! We do not have animal euthanasia dates or euthanasia lists. Any animal that is adoptable stays with us until adopted. For our long-term residents, we may try to transfer the animal to another one of our shelter partners that share our philosophy of adoption first!</p>

        <p>One of the ways we utilize to plan our shelter capacity is to work with those who need to surrender their animal to ask the reason and if we can offer or direct them to assistance so they can keep their pet. We intake surrenders by appointment to manage our capacity.  We ask for a surrender donation to help with the costs of vaccinations and initial care of the animal. ($25 dog/puppy–$15 cat/kitten–$25 cat w/litter).</p>

        <p>We are proud that we can offer a low cost spay and neuter clinic to help control the unwanted pet population.</p>
