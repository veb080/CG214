        <p>Vanessa's Volleyball Background:</p><p>Vanessa began recreational volleyball in elementary school. She moved forward to play as an outside hitter for Delmarva Juniors, a travel club team, from the sixth grade through her senior year of high school. Amidst this time, the club undertook new ownership and was re-titled as the Eastern Shore Elite Volleyball Academy. During her high school career, Vanessa also played for Parkside High's Varsity Volleyball team all four years. Throughout this time, Vanessa was deemed a Bayside South first team player for four consecutive years, and in 2013 was named the Bayside South Conference-wide Player of the Year. In 2013, Vanessa was also named by the Daily Times as delmarva's Seasonal Athlete of the Year. From 2012-2014, she was named Parkside High's Most Valuable Player, and was team captain during her senior year. In 2015, she was recruited for the FIT Tiger's NJCAA Women's Volleyball team. During her freshman year, she started as a dual right-side and outside hitter. During her sophomore year, Vanessa started as the outside hitter and earned the highest team kill-streak of the season. She was awarded with the NJCAA Volleyball Region XV All-Region First Team Award in 2016. Vanessa attributes her success to phenomenal coaches Craig Hollidge, from Delmarva Juniors, and Richard Wood, from Parkside High.</p> <p>About the Sport:</p><p>Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules. It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since 1964.</p>

        <p>The complete rules are extensive. But simply, play proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court. The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The team may touch the ball up to 3 times but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively. Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack, an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court.</p>

        <p>The rally continues, with each team allowed as many as three consecutive touches, until either (1): a team makes a kill, grounding the ball on the opponent's court and winning the rally; or (2): a team commits a fault and loses the rally. The team that wins the rally is awarded a point, and serves the ball to start the next rally. A few of the most common faults include:</p>

        <p>Causing the ball to touch the ground or floor outside the opponents' court or without first passing over the net;
            catching and throwing the ball;
            double hit: two consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same player;
            four consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same team;
            net foul: touching the net during play;
            foot fault: the foot crosses over the boundary line when serving.
            The ball is usually played with the hands or arms, but players can legally strike or push (short contact) the ball with any part of the body.</p>

        <p>A number of consistent techniques have evolved in volleyball, including spiking and blocking (because these plays are made above the top of the net, the vertical jump is an athletic skill emphasized in the sport) as well as passing, setting, and specialized player positions and offensive and defensive structures.
