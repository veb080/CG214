        <h3>About Me:</h3>
    
             <p>My name is Vanessa Bennish and I am 20 years old. I was born and raised in Salisbury, a small city in Maryland, located just west of the coast. Currently, I am in my fourth semester of study at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City, where I am pursuing an AAS Degree in photography. My work can be previewed <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vebphotography/" target="_blank">here</a>. Outside of photography, I enjoy going to the beach, spending time with family, working with animals, and playing sports.</p>
             
             <p>Since beginning my journey at FIT, I have had the opportunity to pursue many of my hobbies and interests. I am a member of FIT's Presidential Scholars Program, Phi Theta Kappa National Honor Society, and NJCAA volleyball team. Outside of school, I work as an on-demand dog walker and a weekend caregiver to Sam, a young man with autism.</p>
    
             <p>Post-graduation, I look forward to moving to Jacksonville, North Carolina with my fiance, where I will pursue my own small photography business, in addition to working for <a href="http://www.promomagnews.com/" target="_blank">Promo Magazine</a> as a remote creative director.</p>
