            <blockquote align="center">“Being mentored by Ben was an absolute eye-opener.
            It was amazing to watch him work because there is a reason for everything he does – he puts so much thought and effort into creating images that connect with the viewer. This was absolutely worth every penny I spent!” - Lauren</blockquote>
